Usually it is enough to add

    export PATH=$(/usr/bin/pathfix -D)

to your .bashrc/.zshrc or similiar rc files to create a working $PATH variable.
This configuration will include every path, that was already your $PATH variable before
and will also scan for other possible paths and add them if they are available.
In most cases you can remove manual $PATH additions from those rc files.

To add other paths, you can add them in the ~/.pathfix.yml configuration file (see pathfix(5))
or create a pull request to add it to the default config.
